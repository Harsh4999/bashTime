### Arguments
	Syntax: 
		./file.sh arg1 arg2 ....
	Use:
		if [[ -d $1 ]] ---> here $1 is arg1

### Variables
	Syntax: 
		variableName="value"
	Print
		echo $variableName

### Conditionals
	Syntax:
		if [ $index -lt 5 ]
		then
			echo $index
		else
			echo "Nothing"
		fi


    Equal: -eq
    Not equal: -ne
    Less than or equal: -le
    Less than: -lt
    Greater than or equal: -ge
    Greater than: -gt
    Is null: -z

------> When comparing strings use "double quotes" to prevent errors:

	For String: 
		echo "Please enter username: "
		read name
		echo $name
		if [ "$name" == "harsh" ];
		then
	        echo "Welcom back harsh"
		else
	        echo "Welcome not back"
		fi

	For Numeric:
		test=3
		if [ $test -lt 44 ]
		then 
		        echo "Harsh"
		else
		        echo "Rahul"
		fi

		if [ $a -eq $b ]
		then
		        echo "You are root"
		elif [ $a -lt $b ]
		then
		        echo "You are god"
		else
		        echo "You are not root"
		fi
#### Note that while using logical operator use : 
##### [[double  brackets ]]
		if [[ $a -eq $b && $a -eq 3 ]]
		then
		        echo "a is 3"
		fi
